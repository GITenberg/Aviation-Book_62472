<p>UNCLE SAM STARTS HIS AVIATION STORY</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c004'>Tom and Jack are
brothers and chums.
They are Boy Scouts. Jack
is first class, but Tom is
only a tenderfoot. Like all
bright, manly boys they are
interested in airships and
are anxious for the time to
come when they can fly too.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom and Jack’s uncle is
a famous aviator, and he
knows all about flying. His
name being Samuel the
boys always call him Uncle
Sam, and they sometimes
jokingly pretend to think
that he is the great Uncle
Sam who represents the
United States.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom and Jack knew that the best way to find out about airships
was to ask their Uncle Sam. So, as soon as they saw him, they made
him consent to tell his wonderful story of aviation.</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom and Jack were all ears as their uncle started his aviation story.</p>

<p class='c005'>“First,” he began, “I shall tell you the thrilling tale of Man’s long
striving to learn how to rival the birds. In myths and fairy tales
there were men and goblins who had wings or who owned winged
chariots and animals. But real, everyday people never learned how to
go up in the air until 1783.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The very year England and the United States made peace after the
Revolutionary War!” exclaimed Tom.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/illus_004.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE ASCENSION OF MONTGOLFIER’S BALLOON</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Don’t interrupt Uncle Sam;
it is not polite,” advised Jack.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” continued Uncle
Sam, “it was on June 5, 1783
that Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier,
two French brothers,
sent up the first balloon. You
can just imagine the amazement
it caused when it arose
from the ground.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Many successful experiments
were made with balloons;
but they were harder to run
than old-time sailboats. A
balloon could not fly against
the wind. In a storm or a
heavy gale it would be wrecked
and the passengers killed. A
machine was needed that
could speed against the wind
and not upset in a heavy blow.</p>

<p class='c005'>“A few inventors tried to
solve the flying problem with
motor-driven balloons such as the German Zeppelin. But most
attention was given to heavier-than-air machines known as aeroplanes.
Aeroplanes are called heavier-than-air to distinguish them from
balloons, which, being inflated with gas, are lighter than air. There
were many discouraging years of hard thought and labor before
success came. Finally, in 1905, two American brothers, Wilbur
and Orville Wright, invented the first successful flying machine;
and in a series of marvelous flights showed that Man had, at last,
rivaled the birds.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/illus_005a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Numerous inventions have made
man almost the equal of the birds in the
air. Flying has been made nearly as safe
as riding on horseback or in an automobile.
The aeroplane is now a necessity
in times of war and peace.
Its startling deeds will be
the subject of the story I’m
about to tell.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Of course, you want to know something about the man who runs
an aeroplane,” said Uncle Sam.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Indeed, we do,” replied both
boys at the same time.</p>

<p>GROUP OF FRENCH AVIATORS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Now,” continued
Uncle Sam, “to become
a military aviator a
man must, first of
all, have a strong,
healthy body, a
quick, active mind, and iron
nerves. There are many
good aviators that wouldn’t
be good <i>military</i> aviators,
because the strain of war
would prove too much for
them. If a man is just
right in body and mind,
they send him to an aviation
training camp where
he is taught to fly.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/illus_009.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>LEARNING TO FLY BY WATCHING THE EXPERT AVIATOR</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“At the training camp
he is instructed in the care
of an aeroplane and its
powerful motor. He goes
up in the air a number of
times with an expert
aviator. By constantly
watching the expert, he
learns to fly. Then he learns many dazzling stunts—to loop-the-loop,
make figure eights, fly upside down, and other dangerous maneuvers.</p>

<p class='c005'>“After the new aviator knows how to care for an aeroplane and fly
perfectly, he is taught wireless telegraphy, and shown how to take
aerial photographs, fire machine guns and drop bombs. As soon as he
learns all these things, he’s a full-fledged aviator, and ready to go into
active service for his country.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Tom and Jack had their eyes wide open in wonder as Uncle Sam
continued:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Ordinary flying, as I told you boys before, is now almost as safe as
riding on horseback or in an auto. But, in time of war, running a
military aeroplane is the riskiest work in the world. When I tell
you of the marvelous, death-defying deeds military aviators have
done, I doubt if you will
believe me. Yet everything
is absolutely true.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>AEROPLANE DIRECTING ARTILLERY FIRE</p>
</div>
</div>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/illus_011.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>AVIATORS TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“An aviator’s most important
duties are to take
photographs of the enemy’s
location and direct artillery
fire. The aviator must
seek out the enemy and
learn their exact position.
He must discover, if he
can, about how many men
and guns they have; how
well they are fortified; how
hard or easy it is to attack
them. He makes many
photographs and sketches
which are valuable to his
officers in planning an
attack.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“You haven’t told us how the brave aviator directs artillery fire,”
broke in Tom.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’m getting to that now,” said Uncle Sam. “You know that there
was a time when a man who fired a cannon could see his target. But
now, a cannon, or the artillery, fires at a range of from six to thirty
miles. No matter how big the target, it is impossible to see it from
such a distance, especially when trees, mountains or fogs are in the
way. Firing artillery is now a matter of calculation. Just where to
shoot has to be figured out by means of maps, instruments, and mathematics.
Quite often the figuring is not exactly right. The aviator
must go up—bombs and shells bursting all around him—and discover
if the guns are hitting the mark. When a shot doesn’t strike in the
right place, the aviator
sends directions by wireless
for firing the next
shell so that it will hit
the enemy’s position and
destroy it.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>BATTLEPLANES CONVOYING PHOTOGRAPHING AEROPLANES</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Not all the excitement
is over the battle
lines. One of the most
thrilling experiences an
aviator can have is to
fight off enemy aeroplanes
and Zeppelins
when they come to
drop bombs on a city
or town. Cities liable
to be raided by hostile
machines are protected
by lookout towers. As
soon as the Zeppelins are
sighted, the men in the towers toot shrill blasts on loud siren horns.
At the signal of the horns every light in the attacked city is put out,
and all the people rush into houses and cellars for safety. Big anti-Zeppelin
guns are pointed skyward to fire destruction-dealing shells at
the enemy overhead.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The brave aviators, who protect the city, start their machines and
go up in the air to drive off the foe—amid the reek of fire and the
scream of shot and shell. The battle is usually short. The swift defending
aeroplanes, with their machine guns constantly spitting bullets,
fight rings around the Zeppelins. The big guns on the ground send
deadly missiles through many of the enemy airships. All of a sudden
one bursts into flames. With a roar and a bang it hurtles to the earth.
In the next moment, still
another is hit. One of the
doomed men saves himself
by dropping off in a huge
floating parachute. He is
made prisoner the minute he
touches ground.</p>

<p>TOOTING THE SIRENS OF WARNING</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“In a little while the
remnant of the once-proud
enemy air fleet flees in mortal
terror. The day is saved. The
heroic aviators, who successfully
defended the city, return
to earth amid the cheers of
the grateful people.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Usually the damage done
is unimportant from a military
point of view. Several
non-combatants are killed
and a few houses and an occasional
church are damaged.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, we will go back to
the firing line, and see how the aeroplane is used in connection with
the land fighting.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Many German aeroplanes come to grief by trying to battle British
tanks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“What’s a British tank?” put in Jack.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I thought everyone was familiar with the tank, but as you
evidently are not, I shall explain what it is. A tank is a great big battle
car, protected with heavy shot-proof steel and armed with guns. It
can travel anywhere—over hills, walls, trenches, through mud, bushes,
and trees. Many people call a tank a land-battleship.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now that you know
what a tank is, I will go on
with my story. When the
British attack the Germans,
they often use tanks, which
rumble along, crushing everything
before them. The
enemy forces are driven
back in terror. In reckless
despair they try to save the
day by pitting their aeroplanes
against these unbeatable
steel monsters.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Aeroplanes fighting
British tanks are practically
helpless and seldom attack
them. ‘Zip! Zip! Bang!’
go the machine guns of the
hostile aeroplanes. But the rain of shot and shell rattles harmlessly
against the huge armored tanks. ‘Boom! Bang!’ roar the tanks’
heavy guns. Down drops one enemy aeroplane, in a horrible wake of
flames and exploding gasoline. It strikes the earth—a shattered tangle
of wire and wood. The aviator, of course, is dashed to death. Another
of the foe’s machines is struck; and still another. All meet the same
fate. Nothing can resist the tanks.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Such battles must be more exciting than fairy tales and novels,”
exclaimed Tom and Jack in breathless wonder.</p>

<p class='c005'>“There’s one thing our aviators do sometimes that is seldom
excelled for courage and daring,” said Uncle Sam, pleased with the way
his nephews were enjoying his story. “The enemy soldiers are very
strongly entrenched behind earthworks and barbed wire fences. When
our infantry find it impossible to make them flee, our bold aviators are
assigned to the task.</p>

<p>THEY SWOOP DOWN OVER THE TRENCHES</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“With dash and bravery they go up in the air and hover near the
hostile positions. Suddenly, like eagles they swoop down over the
trenches shooting at the frightened enemy. ‘Zip! Crack! Bang!’ rattle
their machine guns. Those who are not killed or seriously wounded
flee in terror into the dugouts for safety.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Then, quick as a flash, our men rush in and capture the trench
before enemy reinforcements come up. The courageous aviators are
wildly cheered but haven’t time now to listen to the praise; they must
go up in the air again to protect their comrades from enemy aeroplanes,
which lurk everywhere waiting for a chance to drop bombs.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“By the way, Uncle Sam,” asked Jack, “why do aviators wear such
heavy clothing?”</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/illus_021.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“It must be very cold
up in the air,” thought
Tom to himself, not saying
anything for the
first time.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s frightfully cold
up above the clouds,”
said Uncle Sam. “The
higher you fly the colder
it becomes. Up in the
sky, I have often felt a
temperature below zero,
while down on the earth
it was comfortable and
warm. Later on in
school, you boys will
learn that the sun’s rays
give very little heat
until they reach the earth. I would explain the reason myself, but I
want to go on with the story.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Our aviators are flying around in the sky about three miles above
the earth when, all at once, the enemy’s machines dash into view.
The two hostile air fleets see each other almost at the same time, and
quickly prepare for action. A thrilling battle in the air is at hand.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Our machines are outnumbered, but that does not deter us. ‘Rat-a-tat-tat,’
shrieks one of our machine guns. One of the foe is put
out of action. His machine in flames, he falls dizzily to earth.
Marvelous flying is now going on. One of our men loops-the-loop to
get into position. An enemy aviator backs up his machine in mid-air:
then dives down headlong a thousand feet. Swiftly he rights himself
and speeds up firing right, left, and straight ahead. We have a hard
time dodging that dangerous fellow.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/illus_022.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>WE POUNCE ON THE BIG ENEMY BATTLEPLANE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“A big enemy battleplane
gets separated from
the group. In just two
seconds two of our force
pounce upon it. The huge
machine battles skillfully
for a while. Then we force
it into a bad position,
and rain upon it a terrible
storm of bullets from
our machine guns. The
big battleplane goes down,
but fighting to the last.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Night approaches and
envelops the earth with a
blanket of darkness. Powerful
searchlights from
below, each of which is
a wonderful instrument,
scan the heavens with
beams of ghostly white
and yellow. The aeroplanes
still struggle. The
constant flashes from the bursting shells are even more terrible than in
the day time. The scene is still more hideous when an unfortunate
aviator takes the fatal plunge, his machine ablaze. One of our fine
biplanes makes a mistake and gets right in line with an enemy’s gun.
The foe’s machine-gun bullets penetrate its gasoline tank. It explodes
in mid-air, and the biplane rushes to earth in a roaring blaze.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Who wins this great battle?” broke in Tom.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, I’m getting to that now,” said Uncle Sam.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Tom, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. You have done nothing
but interrupt during the whole story,”
declared Jack.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE BATTLEPLANES STRUGGLE IN THE NIGHT</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Now, don’t you boys start quarreling.
You might get in a worse scrape than
the aeroplanes I’m telling about.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now I’ll get back to my story again:</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/illus_024.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>A SAFE LANDING SPOT</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Between nine and ten o’clock, the
two rival air fleets are equally tired of the
strife. Almost at the same time, both
decide to stop
fighting, and
withdraw to
their own sides
of the battleline.
The
struggle itself
might be called
a tie. But
since we kept
the enemy
from dropping
bombs on our
men in the
trenches, the
victory is really
ours.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It is dangerous
for our
airmen to land
their machines
in the dark.
They might
land on bad
ground or in a tree, or possibly collide with some building. To make
landing at night safe and avoid being seen by the enemy, was a problem
we had to solve. We placed powerful electric lights deep in the ground
and covered them with heavy glasses to prevent their breaking. When
the lights are sunk in this manner they can be seen only from above.
Wherever our aviators see one of these lights, they know it marks
a safe landing spot.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now,” said Uncle Sam, “so far as our story is concerned we shall
leave the bloody battlefront,
and I will tell you about the
aeroplane of the sea. The flying
machine of the sea is called
the hydroaeroplane. That is a
rather long name. Seaplane is
an easier word to pronounce,
and is more commonly used.
The seaplane can float like
a boat and fly like an aeroplane.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus_025.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE SEAPLANE CAN SAIL ON THE WATER LIKE A BOAT AND FLY IN THE AIR LIKE AN AEROPLANE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“I suppose you boys have
the same opinion of seaplanes
as most people. You
think the seaplane is
not half as important
as the land
battleplanes I’ve
been telling you
about.”</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/illus_026.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE BLIMP DIRIGIBLE BALLOON</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“That’s right,”
agreed Tom and
Jack.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well,” continued
Uncle Sam
with an air of superior
wisdom, “the aviation
service of the sea is just as important as that of the land. As the
land aeroplanes are the ‘eyes’ of the army, so the seaplanes are the
‘eyes’ of the navy. If it weren’t for these marvelous flying boats,
the German submarines might have succeeded in sinking nearly
all of our merchant ships—the boats that carry food, clothing,
guns, and ammunition to the Allies of Democracy. Sometimes,
too, our seaplanes have helped the battleships to destroy the enemy
fleet.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Just after the World War started, Germany launched her U-Boat
submarines and undertook a campaign which eventually brought this
country into the war. England was in a dreadful fix. Very little
food, clothing, and munitions could get in from America; many of her
fine ships were being sent to the bottom of the sea. There was no way
to stop the U-Boats. What could we do?</p>

<p class='c005'>“In these hours of trial, a smart Englishman invented a motor-driven
balloon called a Blimp. It’s a mystery to me why they named
it a Blimp. But, even with such a modern name, the Blimp could
certainly scout for German submarines—the U-Boats. Whenever a
Blimp found a U-Boat it would send a wireless message to a ship called
a Submarine Destroyer which would chase the submarine and sink it.”</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>BOMB SPLITS ZEPPELIN IN HALF</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“What I can’t understand,” said
Tom thoughtfully, “is why they
need a Blimp or an aeroplane to
find U-Boats? Why can’t the Submarine
Destroyers seek out the U-Boats
for themselves?”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Yes, Uncle Sam, please explain
that,” said Jack.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I’ll gladly tell you the reason,”
said Uncle Sam. “You know that
you can’t see through a window
from the outside when the sun shines on it. It is the same on the sea.
When the light shines on the water, it is impossible to see beneath the
waves. But when an aviator is high overhead the light is not reflected
in his eyes. Therefore, he is able to see twenty, thirty, and, sometimes,
a hundred feet under the surface of the water. Furthermore, a man
high in the air can look around and see more than the man below.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Now, I’ll start where I left off. I shall have to hurry along, as it is
getting late. Since the early days of the great World War, many new
inventions have made sea flying the marvel of the age. Suppose I tell
you boys of a great battle in which the amazing air fleets of the sea
take part.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Two hostile fleets of warships steam defiantly toward each other.
How proudly their banners flaunt gay colors in the breeze! How boldly
their stately bows plough through the sea! How grim, how stern their
gray sides reflect the sunlight! Ere the day is over, many, many ships
of these grand fleets will lie on the ocean floor. Many others will
stagger to home ports—battered wrecks.</p>

<p class='c005'>“High over the enemy fleet are their Zeppelins, floating lazily with
the clouds. Over our warships, darting here and there, are the ‘eyes’
of the fleet—our seaplanes. It won’t be long before the Zeppelins, the
hostile aeroplanes, and our seaplanes are clinched in a struggle to death.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>A MASS OF WRECKAGE THAT STRIKES THE DECK OF ONE OF OUR WARSHIPS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Let us look at
the battleships
again. Many of
them carry small
elevated railways
on which run tiny
cars. These are
called seaplane
catapults. The
word catapult
means, ‘To throw
heavy stones.’ So
we conclude that
these little railways
throw seaplanes. Well, they <i>do</i> throw seaplanes. Let’s inspect one
and see how it is done. The
little car, bearing a big seaplane,
with its propeller spinning, shoots
along the railway track at lightning
speed. At the very end, it
strikes a bumper. Off shoots
the seaplane. The car darts
back to the starting point. When
a battleship clears for action,
the catapult is taken down.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The monster warships have
now begun to fight. Their big
guns are banging and booming—hundreds
of times louder than
thunder. On the decks, behind
the guns, in the engine rooms
and wireless cabins—everywhere,
men are striving, straining every nerve, risking their lives for
the land they love.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s aviation we are talking about, so let’s look high overhead. Our
marvelous seaplanes are spying on the hostile battleships, fighting the
Zeppelins and enemy aeroplanes, and dropping bombs on the foe
below—all at the same time. ‘Rat-a-tat-tat,’ shrieks a seaplane’s
deadly machine gun. With a sickening plunge, an enemy aeroplane
darts down—a streak of flaming wood and tangled metal. Down goes
another—a mass of wreckage that strikes the deck of one of our warships.
A daring aviator dashes up, up, away up in the air; and drops a
bomb on a Zeppelin. Right in the middle strikes the missile of destruction.
The enemy’s cigar-shaped airship makes a headlong dive for
the ocean—split in half. It strikes the bosom of the sea; and disappears
in one final, deafening explosion, which throws the salt spray high into
the air.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE SEAPLANE SHOOTS OFF THE CATAPULT</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Let’s get a glimpse of another part of the battle scene. One of
our seaplanes is flying along at a moderate rate of speed, when the
tell-tale periscope is sighted. A U-Boat is near the surface of the
water. Our aviator drops a remarkable, a terrific bomb. When this
bomb sinks deep enough, the pressure of the water
makes it explode. The force of the underwater
explosion causes anything near it to be crushed
like an egg shell. You can imagine what happens
to the unfortunate submarine.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>SENDING UP A “HUMMING” SHOT A LITTLE TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“All of a sudden, three enemy aeroplanes
dash into view, determined to
attack our seaplane—to avenge the
sunken U-Boat. But when one
of the big guns on our
warship sends up a ‘humming’ shot, a little too close to the foe for
comfort, they withdraw at once.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We finally won this dreadful sea battle, and the seaplanes certainly
deserve a great deal of credit.</p>

<p class='c005'>“If you boys have followed my story, you know the value of land
and sea aviation service in time of war.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“Indeed, I have followed it,” said Tom warmly.</p>

<p class='c005'>“It’s the most interesting tale I ever heard or read,” exclaimed Jack.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Listen to me, boys,” said their Uncle Sam. He was a bit annoyed
and impatient; for he now had little time to spare for interruptions.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>FAST MAIL-CARRYING AEROPLANES WILL MAKE POSTAL DELIVERIES EVERYWHERE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“The greatest benefit from the ‘Conquest of the Air’ will come in
times of peace. Before I go, I shall tell you boys a few of the peace-time
uses of the land aeroplane, the hydroaeroplane or seaplane, the
Zeppelin, the Blimp, the ordinary balloon—all the mechanical birds of
Man’s inventive genius. Some
of these uses you are already
familiar with; some you and I
will live to see; some won’t
come to pass until we are in
our graves.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The greatest aviation service
will likely be transportation,
both for business and
pleasure. Aeroplanes and
motor-driven balloons will
rival steamships, trains, and
automobiles as carriers of
passengers, freight, and mail.
There will be big aerial ocean
liners plying over the Atlantic
and, possibly, the wide Pacific.
Fast mail-carrying aeroplanes,
capable of a speed of two or
more miles a minute, will make postal deliveries everywhere. Letters
from New York will reach Chicago in a few hours. Private aeroplanes,
darting here and there among the clouds, will be as numerous as the
birds. Thousands of seaplanes will sail on and glide over our lakes,
rivers, bays, and oceans.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>CAPRONI TRIPLANE CROSSING THE ALPS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Aerial transportation is not just a thing of the future. It is
already here. In May, 1918, regular aeroplane mail service was begun
between New York City and Washington, D. C. Many men now have
their own aeroplanes or seaplanes, and travel around in them as
commonly as in an automobile. Two brave Italians flew, in a trifle over
seven hours, from Turin, Italy, across the Alps and then to London—a
distance of 650 miles. A gigantic aeroplane has been invented in Italy.
It is called the Caproni Triplane, because a man named Caproni invented
it, and because it bears three sets of planes or wings. It is
able to travel a long distance and carry heavy loads.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>SHIP SAVED BY LIFE LINE THROWN FROM A RESCUE AIRSHIP</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c005'>“Outside of transportation, there are and will be numerous other
peace-time uses for aeroplanes and balloons. But I have time to tell
about only two more—ship saving and aerial weather observation.
Many a ship stranded on the rocks
in a storm can be reached by a life
line thrown from a rescue airship.
An aviator high in the sky can find
out weather conditions not known
on the earth below. From his
reports, we shall be able to make
more accurate weather forecasts.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Well, boys,” said Uncle Sam,
“my aviation story is over, and I
must be on my way.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He gives each boy a warm handshake,
and bids good-bye. He
jumps into his aeroplane, and starts
the motor. The propellers whirl.
The noise of the motor is deafening. Finally, the
big bird skims the ground and gracefully ascends.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/illus_036.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c005'>A beautiful landscape closes the scene. The sun,
in a halo of golden glory, sinks in the west. Uncle
Sam in his aeroplane is a mere speck in the lonely
twilight sky. The boys watch him float out of
sight, and then start for home with their minds full
of aeroplanes, balloons, aviators, aviation.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
